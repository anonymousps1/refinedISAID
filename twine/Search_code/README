This repository contains the code used to take a backtracking  strategy for twine to search a key monomial.

1. run"mkdir 8result"
2. run "make" to gennerate an executable program "twine.run"
3. run "./twine.run" to search a key monomial. 
4.modify "twine.cpp" to determine which (n-1)-degree monomial of plaintext to choose and which 1-degree monomial of ciphertext to choose.
